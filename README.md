# GR_CRASH_DATA_PROJECT

This repository contains analysis of Grand Rapids Crash Data compiled between 2007 and 2017. This analysis is for a GVSU class project in STA 518 taught by Bradford Dykes. The main data set was taken from the grdata website (https://grdata-grandrapids.opendata.arcgis.com/). The site describes itself as a "community platform for exploring and downloading open data". I will also use the Michigan Traffic Crash Facts (MTCF) website to cross-reference data (https://www.michigantrafficcrashfacts.org/).
